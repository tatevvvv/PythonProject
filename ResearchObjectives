Research Objectives:

To evaluate the impact of vitamin supplementation on the rate of GA progression.
        To assess GA size growth differences across various vitamin-supplemented groups.
        To analyze GA progression patterns within different genotypes.
        To adjust for AMD onset date and demographic factors in GA progression analysis.

To assess the effect of vitamin supplementation on the conversion of GA to wet AMD.
        To compare conversion rates to wet AMD across different vitamin-supplemented groups.
        To evaluate conversion differences based on genetic variations.
        To adjust for AMD onset date and demographic characteristics in conversion analysis.

To investigate the response of AMD to anti-VEGF treatments
        To examine treatment effects across different genotypes.
        To evaluate changes in key biomarkers, including central subfield thickness (CST), visual acuity, and retinal fluid levels.
        To adjust for AMD onset date in treatment response analysis.
